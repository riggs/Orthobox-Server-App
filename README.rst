=============

Hopefully this project will import into PyCharm smoothly.

You may need to manually create a virtualenv (via Python Interpreter preferences in PyCharm) called 'orthobox'. If it
doesn't automatically install the requirements, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the virtualenv to install
the required packages.
